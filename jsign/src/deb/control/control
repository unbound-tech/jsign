Description: Code signing for Windows executables, Microsoft Installers and scripts
 Jsign is a Java implementation of Microsoft Authenticode that lets you sign
 and timestamp executable files for Windows, Microsoft Installers (MSI) and
 scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, JScript, WSF). Jsign is platform independent
 and provides an alternative to native tools like signcode/signtool on Windows
 or the Mono development tools on Unix systems.
